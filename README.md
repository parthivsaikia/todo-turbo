# Full-Stack To-Do App with Turborepo, React, and Hono

This repository contains the source code for the comprehensive blog series on building a modern full-stack application. The project is built using a monorepo structure managed by Turborepo, a React Router frontend, a Hono backend, and a PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM.

### üîß Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- pnpm installed globally (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- A running PostgreSQL instance

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/parthivsaikia/todo-turbo.git](https://github.com/parthivsaikia/todo-turbo.git)
    cd todo-turbo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    There is an example environment file in the `packages/db` directory. Copy it to create your own `.env` file.

    ```bash
    cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env
    ```

    Now, open `packages/db/.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    This command will sync your Prisma schema with your database, creating the necessary tables.

    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    pnpm --filter @repo/db db:migrate:dev
    ```

5.  **Run the development servers:**
    This will start the frontend and backend applications concurrently.

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
    - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
